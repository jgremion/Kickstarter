# Kickstarter
To validate my data analyst training offered by DataScientest I worked on a Kickstarter projet.
The goal was to use the open data from the plateform to create a model to predict the success of a campaign.
I used Python's librairies such as pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib and seaborn and I tried to add some text mining.
I created a Power Bi Dashboard to visualise the main data.
